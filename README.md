# TikTok Claim vs Opinion Classification

## Overview
This project explores TikTok engagement and content data to support building a machine learning model that classifies videos as **claims** or **opinions**.

## Business Problem
TikTok needs an automated system to distinguish between factual claims and personal opinions in videos and comments at scale.

## My Role
I inspected and evaluated the dataset structure, data types, engagement metrics, and potential anomalies to assess readiness for modeling.

## Key Analysis Steps
- Reviewed dataset structure and variable meanings
- Checked for missing values and anomalies
- Compared engagement patterns between claim and opinion content
- Evaluated feature suitability for ML classification

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Data Inspection, EDA

## Files
- `TikTok project .ipynb` — Data inspection notebook
- `Executive summaries tiktok.pdf` — Project executive summary
- `PACE strategy document tiktok.pdf` — Planning & analysis reflections

## Next Steps
Clean the dataset, engineer meaningful features, and train a classification model.
